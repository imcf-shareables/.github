# IMCF Shareables

This is a meta-organization linked to the [IMCF][1] that serves as a collection
space for repositories that need a *permalink*, *DOI* and similar as they are
providing code that is referenced in a publication or similar.

The reason for putting them separately is to avoid cluttering up the common IMCF
github space and to avoid confusion with the projects there.

## Zenodo DOIs

Most (hopefully all) of the IMCF projects that are having a Zenodo DOI should be
identifiably by using the `imcf-unibasel` keyword in a search:

* ["imcf-unibasel" labeled projects on Zenodo][2]

[1]: https://github.com/imcf
[2]: https://zenodo.org/search?q=keywords%3A%22imcf-unibasel%22
